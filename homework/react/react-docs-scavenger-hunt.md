### Post answers (and links to where you found them) for each of the questions below:

1. Can we use `npm` with React or do we have to use `yarn`?
      Yes, both can be used
      
2. We are using JSX to write HTML inside of our React. Are we required to use JSX with React? Are there any alternatives?
      You are not required but it is recommended. One alternative is t7.js (source: https://github.com/trueadm/t7)
      
3. Does React re-render the entire component when one part of it changes?
      No, only the item that is changed will re-render

4. Should we ever change `props` (or parameters) inside of a component? 
      Components must act like pure functions with respect to their props (https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
    
5. Are all components classes? 
      No, they are javascript functions (https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

6. List five "Synthetic Events" provided by React:
      Composition event, keyboard event, Focus events, mouse events, image events.

7. Do we have to use ES6 syntax with React?
      No, but if we use ES6 we should also use Babel (https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html#enabling-es6-and-jsx)

8. Where can I go to check out React's built-in Accessibility features?
      In our JSX code.
      https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#accessible-forms

9. List five React Component Lifecycle Methods:
      componentWillUnmount, componentDidUpdate, shouldComponentUpdate, componentWillReceiveProps,componentWillReceiveProps
      (https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html  & https://engineering.musefind.com/react-lifecycle-methods-how-           and-when-to-use-them-2111a1b692b1)

10. Where would I go to check out React's built-in testing tools?
